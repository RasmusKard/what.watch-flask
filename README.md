## 📍 Overview

The IMDb Randomizer project is a Flask web application that allows users to generate and view randomized content from the IMDb database. It provides a user-friendly interface for filtering and sorting movies and TV shows based on criteria such as genre, rating, release year, and more. The project aims to provide an enjoyable and convenient way for users to discover new and interesting content from IMDb, enhancing their entertainment experience.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The system follows a client-server architecture. The server is powered by Flask, serving a web application that generates and serves randomized content with stored session-specific data. The system also handles file management, database retrieval, and error conditions.    |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The system relies on external libraries like Flask for the web framework, pandas for data manipulation, and Beautiful Soup for web scraping IMDb. It also uses IMDb datasets and parquet files for data processing and storage.    |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The codebase is organized into multiple modules and files. Each file contains code related to a specific task, such as data cleaning, merging, splitting, and web application functionality.   |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | Performance is data-dependent. The code handles large IMDb datasets and parquet files, which may present performance challenges during data processing and retrieval.   |
| **🔐 Security**        | Some security measures are present, such as a whitelist for SSRF protection when scraping IMDb.|
| **🔀 Version Control** | The codebase relies on Git for version control, using GitHub as the hosting platform.
| **📶 Scalability**     | The system's ability to handle growth might be limited by the performance considerations associated with large IMDb datasets and parquet files. Scalability could be improved by implementing techniques like distributed computing, parallelization, and sharding the database.  |

| [app.py](https://github.com/RasmusKard/IMDb_Randomizer/blob/main/app.py)                                             | This code snippet defines a Flask web application that serves a randomized content. The application generates and stores session-specific data, retrieves data from the database, and renders HTML templates to display the randomized content. The code also handles error conditions and file management for storing the generated data.             |
| [flask_modules.py](https://github.com/RasmusKard/IMDb_Randomizer/blob/main/modules\flask_modules.py)                 | This code snippet includes functions to retrieve and sort data based on user input, retrieve poster URLs and overviews for movies or TV shows using IMDb ID, and scrape IMDb for information about movies or TV shows. There's also a whitelist of allowed domains for SSRF protection.                                                                |
| [sort_by_input.py](https://github.com/RasmusKard/IMDb_Randomizer/blob/main/modules\sort_by_input.py)                 | This code snippet is a class called Randomizationparameters that is used to apply user input to sort.parquet files based on specified parameters. It contains functions to sort, filter, and remove data from a pandas dataframe.                                                                                                                      |
